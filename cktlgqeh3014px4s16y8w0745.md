## Preptember - Prepare For HacktoberFest 2021

Hey everyone, HacktoberFest is around the corner (just 15 days away) and for all those who are searching for repositories to contribute to this October, worry not, I have gathered a list of repositories best suited for beginners in open source.

---

### What is HacktoberFest?

Hacktoberfest 2021 will be a month-long virtual festival event to celebrate open source contributions. It is the easiest way to get into open source!

During the entire month of October 2021, all you have to do is contribute to any open-source projects and open at least 4 pull requests. Yes, any project and any kind of contribution. You don’t need to be an expert in programming or coding. It can be a bug fix, improvement, or even a documentation change (I don't recommend it, explore where you can do code changes if there are not many)! And win an awesome T-shirt and awesome stickers.

The Hacktoberfest’s simple plain objective is:

**Support open source and earn a limited-edition T-shirt!**

But, it’s not just about the t-shirts or stickers. It's about supporting open source. It's about celebrating open source and giving it back. If you’ve never contributed to open source before, this is the perfect time to get started because Hacktoberfest provides a large list of available contribution opportunities (and yes, there are always plenty for beginners too).

**[HacktoberFest 2021](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)**

Let's look at some of the most awesome beginner-friendly repositories that you can look at and start your contributions right off the bat.

There are so many repositories that I want to include, but that would just make this a messy article. Keeping things short and simple, let's move on to what you should do now.

Take this as homework and go over [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/) and search for beginners issues and repositories and see which resonates with you and just without thinking much, start with your first contributions during this HacktoberFest 2021! All The Best!

> Note: Do not do meaningless contributions like adding extra space or changing the font in documentation, add your programmer thoughts to it before making contributions and explore, give it as much time as it needs for your meaningful contributions to reflect in your choice of project.

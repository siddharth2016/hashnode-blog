## Yet another GitHub Action !

“All parts should go together without forcing. You must remember that the parts you are reassembling were disassembled by you. Therefore, if you can’t get them together again, there must be a reason. By all means, do not use a hammer.”

How do I know this beautiful quote from IBM Manual, 1925?

I don’t !!

This was showing on my GitHub Profile !

It is the magic of [Quote - README](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/quote-readme) GitHub Action, it will show a random wonderful quote/fact on your profile, updating daily !

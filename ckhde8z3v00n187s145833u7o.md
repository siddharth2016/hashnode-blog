Ping Pong, Recently I finished coding the game and it is actually working ðŸ˜‚
Ever wondered, how can I make games, which programming language to use or do I need to learn DSA or Machine Learning?

Until last month, I was also wondering about these questions when I started this project to learn something new.

Programming Language I used: Python

Yes, thatâ€™s it, you need to know how to code in Python and you have covered 90% !

Remaining 10% can be covered using pyglet, an amazing python game library, that you would need for graphics and motion of objects.

And yes, you donâ€™t need to learn DSA or Machine Learning to make this game, it is super simple and anyone can start their journey to game development with this game of Ping Pong.

Go, check it out and explore different functionalities that you can add to this game.

Later, I will be posting a tutorial on how to use pyglet for game development. So stay tuned !

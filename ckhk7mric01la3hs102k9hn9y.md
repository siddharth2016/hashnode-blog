Sayonara Python 3.5 !

As Larry Hastings confirms that there are no more PRs tagged to Python 3.5, the last stable release stands at version 3.5.10 !

Python 3.5, introduced many useful concepts like async I/O programming, ‚Äútyping‚Äù a module and ‚Äú@‚Äù operator, these things made the life of a python programmer easy.

We have seen a whole lot of amazing features being introduced to Python since Python 3.5.10 !

But, one could never argue that Python 3.5 was the dawn of showing the world the power it has !

As we move on to Python 3.9, I could never forget that my journey to programming started with Python 3.5 and with it‚Äôs intriguing features !

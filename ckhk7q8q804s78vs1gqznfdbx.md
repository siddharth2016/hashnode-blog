‚ÄúDjango Vs Flask‚Äù

Which framework to use ? Which is better and easy to manage ?

All discussions regarding Django Vs Flask can be highlighted with a simple analogy.

‚ÄúYou want to move from point A to point B, consider Flask as a Bike and Django as a Car. Both can get you to your destination but with different approaches.‚Äù

Think about it, discuss with your team and get on using the framework which covers the solution more aptly !

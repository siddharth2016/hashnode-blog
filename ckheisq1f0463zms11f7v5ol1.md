## Hello Open Source ðŸ‘‹

Open Source can be tough (was for me, still is !) if we donâ€™t know some basic concepts or way of doing things the right way !
To give a context, I didnâ€™t know what is PR or merge in git, till my 4th year of B.Tech.

I didnâ€™t have proper guidance on how to explore open source and how to contribute !

I think most of the beginners struggle at getting started with open source !

To ease this process and get a better understanding of how one can create a PR and start contributing to open source, I took an initiative and created a beginner friendly repository on GitHub to help others in getting started !

I have tried to pen down a step-by-step process on how one can contribute to that repository and register his/her first PR.

And...

I know, there are a lot of other repositories out there to make you comfortable with Open Source contributions, but that is the beauty of it ! 

When you go Open Source, you will find a lot of like minded people working together, making the community strong, helping each other with their problem (most of the time similar problem) and giving back to the community.

**Keep Learning, Keep Sharing !**

## DevOps ! DevOps ! DevOps !

DevOps ! DevOps ! DevOps !

The buzzword of recent Software Engineering trends.

But, what exactly is DevOps? Is it simply Development and Operations going hand-in-hand or something more ?

DevOps is much more than Dev + Ops !

👉 It helps to achieve smooth delivery of products.

👉 Establish good communication between teams (which used to be siloed).

👉 As tasks are pretty small but concrete, you have plenty of time to plan next feature or learn something new.

👉 Continuous Integration - make sure each commit maintains it’s integrity.

👉 Continuous Deployment - ensures that all environments have updated code repository and maintains a streamline of processes, making a robust pipeline to production.

👉 Developers own the project, learns business side, even a fresher can lead a side of the project, no need to depend on team lead to get updates.

Everything is streamlined, not only the development but the whole process of interaction with people !

**DevOps is fun !**

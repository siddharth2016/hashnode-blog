## CPython and more...

So, yesterday I stumbled upon an insightful post on the actual use case for CPython and who should use it, by Nick Coghlan (CPython core dev).

Some of the use cases I found helpful

✔ Personal Automation & Hobby Projects</br>
✔ Organisational Process Automation</br>
✔ Continuously Upgraded Infrastructure</br>
✔ Ephemeral Software</br>
✔ Shared Abstraction Layers

There are so many things he discuss in the article, like

Which audience does CPython primarily serve?
Where does PyPI fit into the picture? (my favourite section)

And, many more !!

Namaste 🙏

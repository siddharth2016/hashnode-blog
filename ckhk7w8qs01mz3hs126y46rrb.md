## GitHub for Mobile 👌

GitHub for mobile, get a lot of done with ease of using your smartphone !

Recently GitHub updated it with new - most in demand - features that you will definitely love (and require !).

It already had review feature that, with it’s inception for mobile, have registered more than 700,000 reviews and around 350,000 merges !

That’s a huge task done within your palm, while having a tea or coffee !

And last month it gave several new updates 👇

👉 GITHUB FOR MOBILE FEATURES AN OVERHAUL OF THE CODE REVIEW EXPERIENCE

👉 ABILITY TO TURN OFF LINE WRAPPINGS

❄️ It was super difficult to view line of codes in mobile !</br>
❄️ But now with a toggle added for line wrappings, will save a lot of time !

👉 CHANGE EMAIL ASSOCIATED WITH COMMIT

❄️ You need a little more control on how your commit appears ?</br>
❄️ Add email associated with commit/merge and change it's description as well.

👉 JUMP TO OPTION TO REVIEW MULTIPLE FILES

❄️ Dealing with larger reviews with code spanning multiple files ?</br>
❄️ Don't worry, now you can bounce between different files and review with ease !

👉 COMMENTS ON MULTIPLE LINES OF CODE

❄️ Last year support for comments on multiple lines of code was launched on GitHub's web interface.</br>
❄️ Now you can do the same on mobile app !

Now it's super easy for you to contribute to open source.

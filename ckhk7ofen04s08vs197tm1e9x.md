"Machine Learning"
"Don't know what is Machine Learning"
"Don't know what happens in Machine Learning"
"Don't know if it is your cup of tea"

If you are still in doubt of what is Machine Learning or what actually happens in Machine Learning ?

[Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) - A Google initiative to help people understand the gist of Machine Learning

[ML-Playground](https://ml-playground.com/) - An Open Source website to help you play around with various ML models

These 2 websites are at my top recommendation, whenever someone asks me what is Machine Learning.

Mention your resources, papers, books, videos or site you loved to start your ML journey.

## Update Image - README, See random image on your GitHub Profile README

Yep, you read it right ! There is a GitHub Action that lets you put a random image (from a collection of yours) on your GitHub Profile README. Here I am again, with another no-so-useful GitHub Action ! Not saw the previous Action ? Check it out [here](https://blog.codekaro.info/quote-readme-see-wonderful-quotesfun-facts-on-your-github-profile-readme).

The result before diving into steps:

Here the image highlighted will keep on changing in every 24 hours (from a collection of my images), you can use a collection of your preferred images and see them changing on your GitHub Profile README, with a new profile image to start each day !

---

Without dragging it further, keeping it short and simple, here are the steps:

### 1. Update your Profile `README.md` file. 

Add following in you Profile `README.md`, wherever you want your images to appear. Do not forget to commit the file üòâ

```html
<!--START_SECTION:update_image-->
<!--END_SECTION:update_image-->
```

It should look something like this:

![step_1_image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607837190541/PBRrwxA_w.png)

Profile `README.md` should be present in `<username>/<username>` repository. Need to know more about profile repository/README, check out official [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).

### 2. Add your preferred images.

You need to have your own collection of images that you want to be displayed on your README.

Create a folder `.github/images` on your GitHub Profile Repository to store the images.

To create this folder, you can do a `git push` from your local repository (given images are in `.github/images` folder). Check [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12258399/how-do-i-create-a-folder-in-a-github-repository) for more info on creating a folder on a GitHub Repository.

It should look something like this:

### 3. Add workflow (yaml) file.

Now, click on `Actions` tab on top of your profile repository `<username>/<username>`.

![step_3_actions_tab.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607837266163/-7CR4YmhU.png)

Then, set up a workflow yourself.

![step_3_setup_workflow.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607837282956/Vx332oW45.png)

Remove all the pre-entered contents of the yaml file and add the following:

```yaml
name: Update Image Readme

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    # Runs at 1 UTC everyday
    - cron: "0 1 * * *"

jobs:
  update-readme:
    name: Update Image README
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: siddharth2016/update-readme-image@main
        with:
          IMG_ALT: <alt-message> #image alt to be displayed if image is not mapped correctly
```

There are more options available to customize your workflow, check out a more detailed explanation [here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/update-image-readme).

Name this yaml file as `update-image-readme.yml` or whatever suits you best and commit the workflow yaml file.

### 4. Test your action and see the Magic üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Now, again go to `Actions` tab.

![step_3_actions_tab.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607837387299/-kTlBqS8z.png)

Click `Update Image Readme` under workflows.

![step_4_update_image_readme.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607837411142/FfTgKW6r-.png)

Then `Run workflow`->`Run workflow`, wait for it to complete.

![step_4_run_workflow.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607837433373/S7lcvZUGF.png)

And once the action is done then check your Profile README and see a random image (from your collection) !

![step_4_result.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607837455981/DqMIm8N9K.png)


Additionally you can link it back to the original repository to show your support for this action !

Change `README.md` like this

```html
<a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/update-image-readme">
<!--START_SECTION:update_image-->
<!--END_SECTION:update_image-->
</a>
```

Well, that was it, if you followed these steps you would be seeing an amazing image from your collection on your Profile README.

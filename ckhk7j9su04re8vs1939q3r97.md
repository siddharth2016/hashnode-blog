Dunder methods in Python not only helps in operator overloading, but it gives the power to instantiate a class however we want (talking about `__new__` method).

In my opinion, most important “Dunder” or “Magic” methods that everyone should consider while building a class are:

✔ `__new__`</br>
✔ `__repr__`</br>
✔ `__getattr__` and `__setattr__`</br>
✔ `__iter__` and `__next__`</br>
✔ `__enter__` and `__exit__`</br>

What are some of your most commonly used dunder methods that you consider while designing a class ?

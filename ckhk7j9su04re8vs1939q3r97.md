## Python Dunder Magic 🐍

Dunder methods in Python not only helps in operator overloading, but it gives the power to instantiate a class however we want (talking about __new__ method).

In my opinion, most important “Dunder” or “Magic” methods that everyone should consider while building a class are:

✔ __new__
✔ __repr__
✔ __getattr__ and __setattr__
✔ __iter__ and __next__
✔ __enter__ and __exit__

What are some of your most commonly used dunder methods that you consider while designing a class ?

Writing steps/points before coding, is something I started last month and have seen countless benefits !

Now the code comes out to be less buggy and more readable.

Even at times, when I complete a module and I know the whole picture of the project, then I am able to modify it along the way (without any worries) so that the code becomes more scalable.

It's better to write/draw steps before coding, even if it is not a best design.

Your views on making flowcharts or writing features before an attempt to coding ?
